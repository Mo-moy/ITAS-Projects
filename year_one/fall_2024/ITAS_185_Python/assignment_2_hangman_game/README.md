# Hangman Game

In this project I was task to create a Hangman Game using OOP programming.
This program will ask for your name and the condemned name, after that the game will begin.

To run the program, type python -u "the path file of the RunHangmanGame.py" and ensure that your current directory/folder is where the program is located.
