# Word Homophone 

This is my first project created using Python.
In this project I was tasked of creating a program that will show a menu to user that allow them to add a new word homophone, update a word homophone, remove a word homophone, search for a word homophone, and display the word homophones that were created.

To run the program, just type python -u "the file current pathfile" and enter. Make sure you are in the current folder in which the program was stored.
